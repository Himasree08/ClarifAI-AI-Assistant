ðŸ“š ClarifAI â€“ AI that Listens, Sees and Explains
ClarifAI is a real-time AI-powered educational assistant designed to support students through multimodal inputs and adaptive, emotion-aware responses. It can handle text, voice, and image-based queries, and responds using a local LLM (Gemma 2B via Ollama). The system detects student emotions using webcam analysis and simplifies explanations based on real-time feedback, creating a responsive, classroom-friendly AI tutor.
